**What the project does?**

This project was doing prediction of survival rate on the Titanic by using pythons.

***Background & Challenge

_The_ sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

The Dataset was given and we need to download the titanic.csv file from our assignment folder. 

Here are three possible hypotheses that we can define with this dataset:

1. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
2. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender
3. Determine the survival rate is associated to the age
