**What the project does?**

This project was doing prediction of survival rate on the Titanic by using pythons.

_Background & Challenge_

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” By using passenger data (i e name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Here are three possible hypotheses that we can define with this dataset:

1. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
2. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender
3. Determine the survival rate is associated to the age

The Dataset was given and we need to download the titanic.csv file from our assignment folder. 

**Why the project is useful?**

This project provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (Pclass), gender, age versus survival rate whether it's correlated.

**How users can get started with the project?**

Understand the background, followed by the series of analysis by using pythons and coding to find the figure statistically.

**Where users can get help with your project?**

Users/ Readers can raise their questions or doubts whatever possible.

**Who maintains and contributes to the project?**

I often maintain and contribute to this project when necessary.
